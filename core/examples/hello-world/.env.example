# Optional: Reuse the same wallet across runs
# WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=[your-private-key-array-here]
# Example: [123,45,67,...]

# Optional: Custom Solana RPC endpoint
# SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com

# Note: Leave these commented out to auto-generate a new wallet each run
# This is the recommended approach for first-time users
