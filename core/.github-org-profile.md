# Welcome to Fabrknt

**Web3 Business Intelligence Platform**

We're a community-driven organization creating production-grade business intelligence tools for Web3 teams. Our Suite (PULSE, TRACE, FABRIC) provides complete visibility into project health, growth, and value. We also provide open source SDKs for developers building crypto financial operations.

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

**Democratize access to Web3 business operations and crypto financial infrastructure.**

We believe Web3 teams deserve transparency and trust in business operations. Our Suite tools (PULSE, TRACE, FABRIC) eliminate information asymmetry by providing verified proof of team vitality, marketing ROI, service activity, and project value—enabling high-trust business transfers and operations.

We also believe developers shouldn't have to reinvent security patterns, transaction orchestration, and parallel execution every time they build a payment system or treasury tool. Our SDKs provide battle-tested, open source primitives that make building crypto financial applications accessible to everyone.

## 🌟 Our Values

### Open Source First

Everything we build is open source (MIT license). No vendor lock-in, no proprietary components. Free forever.

### Developer Experience

We prioritize clear documentation, comprehensive examples, and intuitive APIs. If it's not easy to use, it's not ready.

### Security by Default

Financial applications require the highest security standards. We build security into every layer, not as an afterthought.

### Community Driven

The best tools are built by the people who use them. We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaboration from everyone.

### Production Ready

We don't ship prototypes. Every release is tested, documented, and ready for production use.
